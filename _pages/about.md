I was a postdoctoral fellow at the [Centre for Intelligent Multidimensional Data Analysis (CIMDA) Limited](https://www.innocimda.com/index.html) (Hong Kong), supervised by [Prof. Hong Yan](https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~hpyan/). 
Before that, I received my PhD degree (in 2024. Jan) and Bachelor degree (in 2018. Jun) at Harbin Engineering University.
