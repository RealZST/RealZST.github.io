Hi! I am Sitong Zhang, a researcher with **over six years of experience** specializing in **Deep Learning (DL)** and **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)**. I recently relocated to *Espoo, Finland*, for family reasons and am actively exploring new opportunities. ***Feel free to reach out directly if you think I could be a good fit!***

Previously, I was a **postdoctoral fellow** at the [Centre for Intelligent Multidimensional Data Analysis (CIMDA) Limited](https://www.innocimda.com/index.html) (Hong Kong), supervised by [Prof. Hong Yan](https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~hpyan/). 
During my time as a postdoctoral fellow, I developed a CNN-self-attention-based algorithm for indoor positioning and worked with cross-functional teams to create an **AI-integrated Android app** ([demo video](https://youtu.be/-vnb9UGy3qE?si=u0UfoA5vNOybk84e)) that provides **real-time visualization of indoor user location**, improving indoor navigation efficiency. 

Before that, I received my **PhD degree** (Jan. 2024) and Bachelor's degree (Jun. 2018) from Harbin Engineering University. 
My doctoral research focused on the development of advanced **DRL algorithms** to enhance **autonomous navigation** in complex and dynamic environments, with a particular emphasis on optimizing **real-time obstacle avoidance** and long-distance **trajectory planning** for **Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)**. 

My passion lies in **bridging the gap between state-of-the-art AI research and real-world applications**, leveraging cutting-edge technologies to create innovative, impactful solutions that address practical challenges and drive advancements across diverse industries.
