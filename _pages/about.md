Hi! I am Sitong Zhang, a researcher with over six years of experience specializing in Deep Learning (DL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). I recently relocated to Espoo Finland for family reasons and am actively exploring new opportunities. Feel free to reach out directly if you think I could be a good fit!

Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the [Centre for Intelligent Multidimensional Data Analysis (CIMDA) Limited](https://www.innocimda.com/index.html) (Hong Kong), supervised by [Prof. Hong Yan](https://www.ee.cityu.edu.hk/~hpyan/). 
During my time as a postdoctoral fellow, I developed a CNN-self-attention-based algorithm for indoor positioning and worked with cross-functional teams to create an AI-powered Android app that provides real-time multi-floor location visualization, improving indoor navigation efficiency. 

Before that, I received my PhD degree (Jan. 2024) and Bachelor's degree (Jun. 2018) from Harbin Engineering University. 
My doctoral research focused on the development of advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms to enhance autonomous navigation in complex and dynamic environments, with a particular emphasis on optimizing real-time obstacle avoidance and long-distance trajectory planning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).
